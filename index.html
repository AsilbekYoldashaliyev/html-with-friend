                      JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
                      language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
                      host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript
                      can be connected to the objects of its environment to
                      provide programmatic control over them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                      JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
                      Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                      such as operators, control structures, and statements.
                      Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes
                      by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                    </p>
                  </div>
                  <ul class="ul-element">

                      Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by
                      supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
                      Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions
                      allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
                      respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                      and page navigation.

                      Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by
                      supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
                      server. For example, server-side extensions allow an
                      application to communicate with a database, provide
                      continuity of information from one invocation to another
                      of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                      server.

                      JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but
                      fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript
                      language resembles Java but does not have Java's static
                      typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                      Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic
                      control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                      renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                      In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built
                      by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system
                      based on a small number of data types representing
                      numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
                      prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                      class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                      provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited
                      can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports
                      functions without any special declarative requirements.
                      Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                      loosely typed methods.

                      JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java.
                      You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
                      methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether
                      methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not
                      have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                      function return types are not explicitly typed.

                      You use variables as symbolic names for values in your

                      conform to certain rules.

                      A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter,

                      can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case
                      sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z"
                      (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"

                      When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is
                      called a global variable, because it is available to any
                      other code in the current document. When you declare a
                      variable within a function, it is called a local variable,

                      context) within which x is declared, not the block, which

                      Global variables are in fact properties of the global
                      object. In web pages the global object is window, so you
                      can set and access global variables using the
                      window.variable syntax.
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">
                      Consequently, you can access global variables declared in
                      one window or frame from another window or frame by
                      specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a
                      variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you
                      can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                      parent.phoneNumber.

                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const
                    keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as
                    for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter,
                    underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic,
                    numeric, or underscore characters.

                      initialized to a value.

                      The scope rules for constants are the same as those for
                      let block scope variables. If the const keyword is
                      omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a

                    fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                    objects as named containers for values, and functions as
                    procedures that your application can perform.

                    A while statement executes its statements as long as a
                    specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement
                    looks as follows:

                      If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop
                      stops executing and control passes to the statement
                      following the loop.

                    <p class="info">
                      The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is
                      executed. If the condition returns true, statement is
                      executed and the condition is tested again. If the
                      condition returns false, execution stops and control is
                      passed to the statement following while.

                    With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that
                    value to x. Therefore, x and n take on the following values:

                    if the function changes the value of the parameter, this
                    change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.
